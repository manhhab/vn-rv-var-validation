Notes on the raw records (see Section 3.1 of the paper):

* The files contain records outside continuous trading (before 9:15, during the closing call auction 14:30–14:45 and after 14:45),
  in which the index is reported at its reference or closing value. The analysis uses only the continuous sessions 9:15–11:30 and 13:00–14:30.
* The recording format changes on 5 May 2025, when HOSE migrated to a new trading system: from that date each day has exactly
  227 records on a fixed grid, whereas earlier records are irregular.
* Records for April and May 2022 are missing for the VNINDEX.
